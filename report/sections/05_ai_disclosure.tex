\section{Generative AI Usage Disclosure}

Generative AI tools (specifically Cursor AI Assistant) were used extensively throughout this assignment for conceptual clarification, debugging guidance, code structure assistance, and documentation wording. All final code, decisions, and interpretations were written and verified by the student.

\subsection{AI Usage Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Cursor AI Assistant (Claude-based model)
    \item \textbf{Provider}: Anthropic (via Cursor IDE)
    \item \textbf{Primary uses}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Code structure and architecture design for corpus analysis pipeline
        \item Debugging Python import errors and dependency issues
        \item Assistance with LaTeX table generation and formatting
        \item Clarification of Naive Bayes LLR calculations and topic modeling concepts
        \item Documentation and README writing assistance
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time used}: Approximately 4-6 hours of active AI assistance over the course of assignment completion
    \item \textbf{Estimated emissions}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Estimated queries/interactions: $\sim$50-75 interactions over 4-6 hours
        \item Average emissions per query (Claude-based models): $\sim$4.32 g CO$_2$ per query
        \item Calculation: 50 queries $\times$ 4.32 g CO$_2$ = 216 g CO$_2$ (0.216 kg CO$_2$) to 75 queries $\times$ 4.32 g CO$_2$ = 324 g CO$_2$ (0.324 kg CO$_2$)
        \item \textbf{Total estimated emissions}: 0.2-0.3 kg CO$_2$ equivalent
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Student Contribution}
All analysis results, interpretations, and conclusions presented in this report are my own work. The AI assistant was used as a tool for implementation and clarification, but all analytical insights, discussion points, and final code decisions were made and verified by me.
